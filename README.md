Hey Team , 

let me tell you what you need to run this application.
note - i havent hosted it anywhere , so you need to run it on local (please bear with me) 
1 - you need to clone it 
2 - you will need a MySql workbench and will need to configure it as per the application.properites file or vice versa
3 - run it locally and try to hit the api via postman with the payloads you have provided in documnet.

Hope i am clear and you like the code.
