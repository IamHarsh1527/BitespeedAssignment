Hi Team,

Just a quick note on how to run the application locally (as it's not hosted yet — thank you for bearing with me):

    Clone the repository to your local machine.

    Set up MySQL Workbench and configure the database connection as per the application.properties file — or update the file to match your local MySQL setup.

    Run the application locally, and test the /identify API using Postman with the sample payloads provided in the documentation.

Hope everything is clear — and I hope you enjoy exploring the code!
